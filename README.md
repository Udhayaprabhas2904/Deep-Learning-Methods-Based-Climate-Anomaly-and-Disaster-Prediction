# 🌍 Deep Learning Methods Based Climate Anomaly and Disaster Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of natural disasters such as floods, heatwaves, cyclones, and droughts.  
This project leverages **Deep Learning techniques** to analyze climate and disaster-related data for **early prediction, anomaly detection, and risk assessment**, helping authorities and communities take preventive actions.

The system integrates **machine learning models, deep neural networks, and a web-based interface** to provide real-time disaster prediction and visualization.
